This is the prompt for the NFL season which starts in 2025. A few changes from last year: In week 1, all teams start with an Elo of 1500, EXCEPT the final 4 teams from last year's playoffs. Those 4 teams will start with an Elo of 1565, equivalent to a home field advantage.

The NHF designator for no Home Field Advantage will remain.

Jets vs. Giants
