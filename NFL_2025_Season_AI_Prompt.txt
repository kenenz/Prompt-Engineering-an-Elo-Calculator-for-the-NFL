This is the prompt for the NFL season which starts in 2025. A few changes from last year: In week 1, all teams start with an Elo of 1500, EXCEPT the final 4 teams from last year's playoffs (Eagles, Chiefs, Bills, Commanders). Those 4 teams will start with an Elo of 1565, equivalent to a home field advantage. 6 other teams performed well below average, with only 3 wins last season (Browns, Titans, Giants), and 4 wins last season (Patriots, Raiders, Jaguars) Those 6 teams will start the season with a 65 point disadvantage from average (1435).

The NHF designator for no Home Field Advantage will remain.

Games which will have NHF designation based on proximity of the teams and fan sentiment are:
