NHF designation has been added for no Home Field Advantage
When playoff season comes around, there will most likely be an Elo adjustment for the head coaches with the best playoff records

Games which should probably have NHF designation based on proximity and fan sentiment:
Jets vs. Giants
Raiders vs. Chargers
Raiders vs. Rams
Rams vs. Chargers
Ravens vs. Commanders
Eagles vs. Ravens
Eagles vs. Commanders
Jets vs. Eagles
Giants vs. Eagles

This needs to be double checked before the final run of the AI ELO.
